## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(airquality)
air=lm(Ozone~Wind,data=airquality)

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
x=airquality[,3]
y=airquality[,1]
```


## Including Plots


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(x,y)
abline(air)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
